# 😷 Mask vs No Mask Detection using YOLOv11

This project is a real-time **Mask vs No Mask detection system** built using **YOLOv11** and deployed for quick inference.  
The model detects whether a person in an image or video frame is wearing a **mask** or **not**, providing bounding boxes and confidence scores.

The model is trained from scratch on a custom dataset for mask detection and leverages the efficiency and accuracy of **YOLOv11** for object detection.
